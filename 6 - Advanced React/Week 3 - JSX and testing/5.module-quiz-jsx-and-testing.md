# Module quiz: JSX and Testing

1. What are some of the features of component containment? Select all that apply.
    - The fact that some components don’t know their children ahead of time. 
    - A component that uses the `children` prop to pass `children` elements directly as their content.
    - A special case of other components. 
    - A component that acts as a generic box.
    ```
    A: The fact that some components don’t know their children ahead of time. 
            A component that uses the children prop to pass children elements directly as their content.
            A component that acts as a generic box.
    ```

2. What are the props that all components have by default? Select all that apply.
    - `type` 
    - `children` 
    - `render` 
    ```
    A: children
    ```

3. What is a React Element? Select all that apply.
    - A React Component that represents a simple DOM node, like a button. 
    - An intermediary representation that describes a component instance. 
    - A JavaScript object that represents the final HTML output.
    ```
    A: An intermediary representation that describes a component instance. 
            A JavaScript object that represents the final HTML output.
    ```

4. Assuming you have the below component, what are all the features implemented from component composition with children?
    ```jsx
    function ConfirmationDialog() {
        return (
            <Dialog color="blue">
                <h1 className="Dialog-title">
                    Thanks!
                </h1>
                <p className="Dialog-message">
                    We’ll process your order in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
            </Dialog>
        );
    }
    ```
    - Component specialization. 
    - Component specialization and component containment. 
    - Component containment. 
    ```
    A: Component specialization and component containment. 
    ```

5. What are some of the use cases that the `React.cloneElement` API allows you to achieve? Select all that apply.
    - Extend the functionality of children components. 
    - Modify children's properties. 
    - Add to children properties. 
    ```
    A: Extend the functionality of children components. 
            Modify children's properties. 
            Add to children properties. 
    ```

6. Assuming you have the following `Row` component that uses `React.Children.map` to perform some dynamic transformation in each `child` element, in order to add some custom styles, what’s wrong about its implementation? Select all that apply.
    ```jsx
    const Row = ({ children, spacing }) => {
        const childStyle = {
            marginLeft: `${spacing}px`,
        };

        return(
            <div className="Row">
                {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
                    child.props.style = {
                        ...child.props.style,
                        ...(index > 0 ? childStyle : {}),
                    };
                    
                    return child;
                })}
            </div>
        );
    };
    ```
    - Each child is missing a key, causing potential problems if the list order changes. 
    - You can’t use the spread operator in the style prop. 
    - Each child is being mutated. 
    ```
    A: Each child is being mutated. 
    ```

7. Assuming you have the following set of components, what would be logged into the console when clicking the Submit button that gets rendered on the screen?
    ```jsx
    const Button = ({ children, ...rest }) => (
        <button onClick={() => console.log("ButtonClick")} {...rest}>
            {children}
        </button>
    );

    const withClick = (Component) => {
        const handleClick = () => {
            console.log("WithClick");
        };

        return (props) => {
            return <Component onClick={handleClick} {...props} />;
        };
    };

    const MyButton = withClick(Button);

    export default function App() {
        return <MyButton onClick={() => console.log("AppClick")}>Submit</MyButton>;
    }
    ```
    - `"AppClick"`
    - `"ButtonClick"`
    - `"WithClick"`
    ```
    A: "AppClick"
    ```

8. Among the below options, what are valid solutions to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns? Select all that apply
    - Higher order components. 
    - Components that consume context. 
    - Custom hooks. 
    - Render props pattern. 
    ```
    A: Higher order components. 
            Custom hooks. 
            Render props pattern. 
    ```

9. What does the screen utility object from react-testing-library represent when performing queries against it?
    - The whole page or root document
    - Your laptop screen
    - The whole virtual DOM 
    ```
    A: The whole page or root document
    ```

10. When writing tests with Jest and react-testing-library, what matcher would you have to use to assert that a button is disabled?
    - `toHaveBeenCalled` 
    - `toHaveAttribute`
    - `toBeInTheDocument`
    ```
    A: toHaveAttribute
    ```
